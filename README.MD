# TR-1 Governance Codex

**Executable law for dynamical system certification.**

This repository defines a complete, closed-loop governance framework for
triadic resonance certification (TR-1).

No expert override.  
No qualitative appeal.  
No narrative discretion.

A system either:
1. Passes TR-1
2. Fails TR-1 (and is named)
3. Repairs and re-enters under covenant
