# TR-1 Governance Codex (v1.0.0)

This document is the canonical specification for TR-1 certification:
- **Part I:** The Law (TR-1 Formal Judgment)
- **Part II:** The Reversion Alphabet (Failure Enum + Soup-Signature)
- **Part III:** The Audit (Ceremonial Scroll + Technical Shadow)
- **Part IV:** The Re-Entry Covenant (C1–C6)

No expert override. No qualitative appeal. No retroactive amendment.

## Part I — The Law (TR-1 Formal Judgment)

### Judgment Form
We write:

**Γ ⊢ S : TR-1(T, ε)**

Meaning: system **S** is certifiably in triadic resonance on horizon **T** within tolerance **ε**.

### Unified Triadic Sequent (Premises ⇒ Conclusion)

TR-1 may be certified **iff** all predicates hold:

**P0 — Finite-mode validity**  
System is intrinsically finite-dimensional **OR** a truncation certificate exists:
‖z − z_N‖ ≤ Δ_N(ε, T)

**P1 — Candidate enumeration is fixed**  
Cand(S; ε) is generated by a fixed, public calibration rule. No custom filters.

**P2 — Uniqueness & isolation (runner-up exclusion)**  
The admissible triad is unique and separated from the runner-up by a fixed margin **m = (m_δ, m_Γ, m_κ)**:
δ′₂ − δ′₁ ≥ m_δ  
Γ₁ − Γ₂ ≥ m_Γ  
|κ₁| − |κ₂| ≥ m_κ

Failure of any margin ⇒ reversion to Observed Sync / Diffuse.

**P3 — Dimensionless admissibility (anti-gaming)**  
Admissibility must be scale-invariant:
δ′ ≤ η(ε)  
Γ / ω_max ≥ Γ₀(ε)  
|κ| / κ_max ≥ κ₀(ε)

If margins fail due to degeneracy ⇒ Diffuse / Observed only.

**P4 — Uniform reduction validity (no “fine until jump”)**  
Uniform bound across the entire horizon:
sup_{t ∈ [0,T]} ‖R(t)‖ ≤ RB(ε, T)  
(and/or sup ratio bound with θ < 1 when applicable)

If the sup cannot be bounded ⇒ TRUNCATE T or REVERT.

**P5 — Identity-based exchange test (not just fit)**  
Existence of parameters π* such that:
‖y(t) − ŷ_NF(t; π*, τ₁)‖ ≤ ρ(ε)  for all t ∈ [0,T]  
AND π* is stable across windows W (no ghosting)  
AND robust under subsampling (no rank-swap)

If ambiguous or unstable ⇒ Observed only.

**P6 — Hazard is early-stop only**  
Hazard features may shorten T (conservative truncation).  
They may never justify extending T or certifying beyond the law.

## Part II — The Reversion Alphabet (Failure Enum)

TR-1 failure is not narrative; it is a finite ontology.

**Primary codes (canonical):**
- P0_TRUNCATION_FAIL
- P2_GAP_COLLAPSE
- P5_GHOSTING
- STEP6_RANK_SWAP
- P4_REMAINDER_BOUND_FAIL
- P3_SCALE_GAMING_DETECTED
- P1_CALIBRATION_NONDETERMINISM
- P6_EARLY_STOP_TRIGGERED

All failures bind a **Soup-Signature**:
- GAP_COLLAPSE
- RANK_SWAP
- GHOSTING
- TRUNCATION_LIE
- SCALE_SPOOF

## Part III — The Audit

### A. Ceremonial Scroll (human-facing)
Claim → Trial → Collapse → Verdict → Witness → Seal

### B. Technical Shadow (machine-facing)
Metric chain-of-custody, hashes, deterministic pipeline, evidence refs.

The two documents must be mutually consistent. No drift.

## Part IV — The Re-Entry Covenant (C1–C6)

Re-entry is not appeal; it is reconstruction.

- **C1 Parameter stabilization**
- **C2 Margin recovery**
- **C3 Windowed coherence**
- **C4 Remainder compression**
- **C5 Hazard suppression**
- **C6 Witness audit requirement** (Repair Dossier)

A successful C6 Repair Dossier breaks the seal of Secondness and permits a new TR-1 verification cycle.
